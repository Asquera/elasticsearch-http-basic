/**
 * Class that handles the values obtained from the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) HTTP Header
 * field.
 * <p>
 * The X-Forwarded-For (XFF) HTTP header field is a de facto standard for
 * identifying the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web
 * server through an HTTP proxy or load balancer.
 * <p>
 * The usefulness of XFF depends on the proxy server truthfully reporting the
 * original host's IP address; for this reason, effective use of XFF requires
 * knowledge of which proxies are trustworthy, for instance by looking them
 * up in a whitelist of servers whose maintainers can be trusted.
